Here are REQUIREMENTS for endpoint companies

The Business require to know for each company we have in our database, the name of the company and number of jobs this specific company is having.
Sometimes we just need the company names without their number of jobs. Sometimes we need both: the company name and the number of jobs this company is having.
The company name to be returned is the exact data sent by the scraper. In this phase we don't need to translate any company code to a real business legal company name.
In the future we will ask also for Real Legal Business Company Name even if the scraper is sending just a code of this company.
