# Business Requirement Document: Delete Company Logo Endpoint

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop an API endpoint that deletes a company logo from a SOLR index. This endpoint will be used to manage company logo data efficiently by removing existing logos.

## Key Requirements:

1. **Functionality:**
   - The endpoint should accept a company identifier as input.
   - It should delete the logo associated with the specified company from the SOLR index.
   - The endpoint should use Solr's atomic update feature to remove the logo field.

2. **Error Handling:**
   - The endpoint should handle errors gracefully, providing meaningful error messages to users.
   - Specific error handling should include scenarios where the company identifier is missing or the deletion operation fails.

3. **User Experience:**
   - The endpoint should respond quickly to ensure a seamless user experience.
   - The response should include a clear success message or error details.

4. **Data Integrity:**
   - Ensure that the logo data is removed correctly from the SOLR index.
   - The endpoint should only affect the specified company's data.

5. **Security:**
   - Implement appropriate security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access to the SOLR index.

6. **Scalability:**
   - The endpoint should be designed to handle a high volume of requests without impacting performance.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- The endpoint successfully deletes the company logo from the SOLR index.
- The endpoint returns a clear success message or error details.
- Error messages are clear and informative for users.
- The endpoint responds within an acceptable time frame.

## Assumptions and Dependencies:

- The SOLR index is properly configured and populated with company data.
- Necessary infrastructure and resources are available to support the endpoint.

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies:

- **Risk:** Technical issues with the SOLR index could prevent logo deletion.
  - **Mitigation:** Regularly monitor the SOLR index for errors and perform maintenance as needed.

- **Risk:** High traffic could impact performance.
  - **Mitigation:** Implement load balancing and optimize server resources to handle increased traffic.

- **Risk:** Unauthorized access could lead to data breaches.
  - **Mitigation:** Implement robust security measures, including authentication and authorization checks.
