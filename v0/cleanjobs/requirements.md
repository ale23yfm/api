# Business Requirement Document: Delete Jobs by Company from SOLR Index

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop an API endpoint that deletes all jobs from a SOLR index for a specified company. This endpoint will be used to manage job listings efficiently by removing all jobs associated with a particular company.

## Key Requirements:

1. **Functionality:**
   - The endpoint should accept a company identifier (e.g., company name) as input.
   - It should delete all job listings from the SOLR index that are associated with the specified company.
   - The endpoint should return the number of jobs deleted.

2. **Error Handling:**
   - The endpoint should handle errors gracefully, providing meaningful error messages to users.
   - Specific error handling should include scenarios where the company identifier is missing, invalid, or when technical issues prevent job deletion.

3. **User Experience:**
   - The endpoint should respond quickly to ensure a seamless user experience.
   - The response should include a clear message indicating whether the deletion was successful and the number of jobs deleted.

4. **Data Integrity:**
   - Ensure that only jobs associated with the specified company are deleted.
   - The endpoint should not affect jobs from other companies.

5. **Security:**
   - Implement appropriate security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access to the SOLR index.

6. **Scalability:**
   - The endpoint should be designed to handle a high volume of requests without impacting performance.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- The endpoint successfully deletes all jobs for the specified company from the SOLR index.
- The endpoint returns the correct number of jobs deleted.
- Error messages are clear and informative for users.
- The endpoint responds within an acceptable time frame.

## Assumptions and Dependencies:

- The SOLR index is properly configured and populated with job data.
- Necessary infrastructure and resources are available to support the endpoint.

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies:

- **Risk:** Technical issues with the SOLR index could prevent job deletion.
  - **Mitigation:** Regularly monitor the SOLR index for errors and perform maintenance as needed.

- **Risk:** High traffic could impact performance.
  - **Mitigation:** Implement load balancing and optimize server resources to handle increased traffic.

- **Risk:** Unauthorized access could lead to data breaches.
  - **Mitigation:** Implement robust security measures, including authentication and authorization checks.
