# Business Requirement Document: Retrieve a Random Job from SOLR Index

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop an API endpoint that retrieves a random job from a SOLR index. This endpoint will be used to provide users with a random job listing, enhancing user engagement and exploration of job opportunities.

## Key Requirements:

1. **Functionality:**
   - The endpoint should retrieve a single random job from the SOLR index.
   - The job should be selected randomly from all available jobs in the index.

2. **Error Handling:**
   - The endpoint should handle errors gracefully, providing meaningful error messages to users.
   - Specific error handling should include scenarios where no jobs are available in the index or when technical issues prevent job retrieval.

3. **User Experience:**
   - The endpoint should respond quickly to ensure a seamless user experience.
   - The response should include all relevant details about the job, such as job title, description, and company name.

4. **Data Integrity:**
   - Ensure that the retrieved job data is accurate and up-to-date.
   - The endpoint should not return jobs that have been removed or are no longer active.

5. **Security:**
   - Implement appropriate security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access to the SOLR index.

6. **Scalability:**
   - The endpoint should be designed to handle a high volume of requests without impacting performance.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- The endpoint successfully retrieves a random job from the SOLR index.
- Error messages are clear and informative for users.
- The endpoint responds within an acceptable time frame.
- Retrieved job data is accurate and relevant.

## Assumptions and Dependencies:

- The SOLR index is properly configured and populated with job data.
- Necessary infrastructure and resources are available to support the endpoint.

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies:

- **Risk:** Technical issues with the SOLR index could prevent job retrieval.
  - **Mitigation:** Regularly monitor the SOLR index for errors and perform maintenance as needed.

- **Risk:** High traffic could impact performance.
  - **Mitigation:** Implement load balancing and optimize server resources to handle increased traffic.
