# Business Requirement Document: Search Jobs Endpoint

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop an API endpoint that allows users to search for jobs in a SOLR index. This endpoint will provide users with relevant job listings based on their search queries.

## Key Requirements:

1. **Functionality:**
   - The endpoint should accept a search query as input.
   - It should return a list of job listings that match the search query.
   - The endpoint should support pagination to limit the number of results per page.

2. **Error Handling:**
   - The endpoint should handle errors gracefully, providing meaningful error messages to users.
   - Specific error handling should include scenarios where no search query is provided or no results are found.

3. **User Experience:**
   - The endpoint should respond quickly to ensure a seamless user experience.
   - The response should include clear and relevant job listings.

4. **Data Integrity:**
   - Ensure that the search results are accurate and relevant to the query.
   - The endpoint should only return job listings that are present in the SOLR index.

5. **Security:**
   - Implement appropriate security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access to the SOLR index.

6. **Scalability:**
   - The endpoint should be designed to handle a high volume of requests without impacting performance.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- The endpoint successfully retrieves job listings from the SOLR index based on the search query.
- The endpoint returns relevant results that match the query.
- Error messages are clear and informative for users.
- The endpoint responds within an acceptable time frame.

## Assumptions and Dependencies:

- The SOLR index is properly configured and populated with job data.
- Necessary infrastructure and resources are available to support the endpoint.

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies:

- **Risk:** Technical issues with the SOLR index could prevent search results from being retrieved.
  - **Mitigation:** Regularly monitor the SOLR index for errors and perform maintenance as needed.

- **Risk:** High traffic could impact performance.
  - **Mitigation:** Implement load balancing and optimize server resources to handle increased traffic.

- **Risk:** Inaccurate search results could lead to poor user experience.
  - **Mitigation:** Regularly validate the search functionality to ensure relevance and accuracy of results.
