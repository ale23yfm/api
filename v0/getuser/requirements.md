# Business Requirement Document: Retrieve User Information Endpoint

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop an API endpoint that retrieves user information from a SOLR index. This endpoint will be used to fetch specific user details based on a unique identifier.

## Key Requirements:

1. **Functionality:**
   - The endpoint should accept a user identifier as input.
   - It should return the user's information stored in the SOLR index.
   - The endpoint should exclude unnecessary fields (e.g., version information) from the response.

2. **Error Handling:**
   - The endpoint should handle errors gracefully, providing meaningful error messages to users.
   - Specific error handling should include scenarios where no user identifier is provided or the user is not found.

3. **User Experience:**
   - The endpoint should respond quickly to ensure a seamless user experience.
   - The response should include clear and relevant user information.

4. **Data Integrity:**
   - Ensure that the retrieved user data is accurate and up-to-date.
   - The endpoint should only return data for the specified user.

5. **Security:**
   - Implement appropriate security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access to the SOLR index.

6. **Scalability:**
   - The endpoint should be designed to handle a high volume of requests without impacting performance.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- The endpoint successfully retrieves user information from the SOLR index based on the provided identifier.
- The endpoint returns relevant and accurate user data.
- Error messages are clear and informative for users.
- The endpoint responds within an acceptable time frame.

## Assumptions and Dependencies:

- The SOLR index is properly configured and populated with user data.
- Necessary infrastructure and resources are available to support the endpoint.

## Risks and Mitigation Strategies:

- **Risk:** Technical
